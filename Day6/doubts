 polymorphism

 method1(22)         # why comma in output (22,) ??


 encapsulation-> similar to private method, is there any way to call private variable outside the class?

 why below block is not working
 # read file and save in a list
with open("text5.txt", 'w') as fr:
    fr.write("heelo")
    line_list = fr.readlines()




    for user induced error do we use ImportError always and then define error message?
